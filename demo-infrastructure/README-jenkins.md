# Jenkins pipeline

Used to run the pipeline stages via Jenkins. Relies either on an existing integration node being available 
with the JDBC credentials having been set up or else on an ACE-as-a-Service (ACEaaS) instance being 
available, and will run on Windows (integration node only) or via docker on Unix platforms to either target.

![Pipelines overview](/demo-infrastructure/images/jenkins-pipelines-overview.jpg)

## Running Jenkins

Jenkins can be run from a command line (using Java11) as follows once downloaded:
```
java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8080
```
See https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started/ for details and download locations.

## Getting started with the pipeline

Forking this repo is advisable, as then it can be modified to use the correct database location
and integration node. In the fork, the following values should be changed in either Jenkinsfile
or Jenkinsfile.windows depending on which platform is used:
- databaseName
- serverName
- portNumber

These values should be set from the DB2 on Cloud credentials (see [cloud-resources.md](cloud-resources.md))
so that the component tests can run successfully. This is required regardless of the pipeline
deploy target (integration node or ACEaaS).

For Windows, the ACE_COMMAND environment variable may need to be changed to match a locally-installed
version of ACE (currently set to 12.0.11). Container support is not required.

For Linux, the pipeline will use containers for the actual build steps, and this requires either 
the `ace` container image from cp.icr.io or the `ace-minimal-build` container image to be created 
first (for users without an IBM Entitlement Key). The use of a container to run ACE commands ensures 
that the Jenkins environment (for example, Java level) does not affect ACE commands, and ensures 
a consistent environment for building ACE artifacts. See the [ace-minimal-build](/demo-infrastructure/docker/ace-minimal-build) 
directory for information on building the image, or [Obtaining an IBM App Connect Enterprise 
server image](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/12.0?topic=cacerid-building-sample-app-connect-enterprise-image-using-docker#aceimages__title__1)
to download the `ace` image. The Jenkinsfile will need to be updated to use the correct image.

The ACE version does not have to match the exact modification level (12.0.X) of the deploy target
(integration node or ACEaaS) but keeping build containers up-to-date is a good idea in general in
order to benefit from fixes and new capabilities.

Once the Jenkinsfile values have been updated and containers built if needed, then the pipeline
can be constructed, but it may be a good idea to change "GitHub API usage" under "System 
Configuration" -> "System" in the Jenkins settings as otherwise messages such as the 
following may appear regularly:
```
17:07:37 Jenkins-Imposed API Limiter: Current quota for Github API usage has 52 remaining (1 over budget). Next quota of 60 in 58 min. Sleeping for 4 min 9 sec.
17:07:37 Jenkins is attempting to evenly distribute GitHub API requests. To configure a different rate limiting strategy, such as having Jenkins restrict GitHub API requests only when near or above the GitHub rate limit, go to "GitHub API usage" under "Configure System" in the Jenkins settings.
```
Adding GitHub credentials will also fix these errors, as it avoids (heavily-restricted) anonymous access.

The procedure beyond this point differs somewhat depending on the target, as the deployment
configuration for local integration nodes and ACEaaS require different values.

## Local integration node target

![Pipeline overview](/demo-infrastructure/images/jenkins-pipeline.png)

The following values should be changed in either Jenkinsfile or Jenkinsfile.windows 
depending on which platform is used:

- integrationNodeHost
- integrationNodePort
- integrationServerName

To create the pipeline (and following the Jenkins pipeline tour instructions), a "multibranch 
pipeline" should be created and pointed at the github repo. For Windows users, the pipeline 
should be configured to look for `Jenkinsfile.windows`, while the default of `Jenkinsfile` is
appropriate for other platforms:

![jenkinsfile-windows-configuration](jenkinsfile-windows-configuration.png)

If the default `Jenkinsfile` is used, then Jenkins is likely to ask for Docker support on
Windows, which is not necessary: the Windows configuration will run ACE commands directly
without needing a container. Docker support is require on Linux, as described above.

Once the pipeline has been created and branches configured, the JDBC credentials need to be provided
as a username/password credential called `CT_JDBC`. The credentials can be spcified for the pipeline
using the Jenkins UI:

![jenkins-credential-create](jenkins-credential-create.png)

As well as creating the Jenkins credentials, the same values must be provided to the destination
integration node along with a JDBC policy called TEAJDBC. Using mqsisetdbparms for the 
credentials would look as follows:
```
mqsisetdbparms <integration node> -n jdbc::tea -u <db2user> -p <db2password>
```
and the policy should look like
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<policies>
  <policy policyType="JDBCProviders" policyName="TEAJDBC" policyTemplate="DB2_91_Linux">
    <databaseName>BLUDB</databaseName>
    <databaseType>DB2 Universal Database</databaseType>
    <databaseVersion>11.5</databaseVersion>
    <type4DriverClassName>com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver</type4DriverClassName>
    <type4DatasourceClassName>com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2XADataSource</type4DatasourceClassName>
    <connectionUrlFormat>jdbc:db2://[serverName]:[portNumber]/[databaseName]:user=[user];password=[password];</connectionUrlFormat>
    <connectionUrlFormatAttr1></connectionUrlFormatAttr1>
    <connectionUrlFormatAttr2></connectionUrlFormatAttr2>
    <connectionUrlFormatAttr3></connectionUrlFormatAttr3>
    <connectionUrlFormatAttr4></connectionUrlFormatAttr4>
    <connectionUrlFormatAttr5></connectionUrlFormatAttr5>
    <serverName>19af6446-6171-4641-8aba-9dcff8e1b6ff.c1ogj3sd0tgtu0lqde00.databases.appdomain.cloud</serverName>
    <portNumber>30699</portNumber>
    <jarsURL></jarsURL>
    <databaseSchemaNames>useProvidedSchemaNames</databaseSchemaNames>
    <description></description>
    <maxConnectionPoolSize>0</maxConnectionPoolSize>
    <securityIdentity>tea</securityIdentity>
    <environmentParms>sslConnection=true</environmentParms>
    <jdbcProviderXASupport>false</jdbcProviderXASupport>
    <useDeployedJars>true</useDeployedJars>
  </policy>
</policies>
```
and be deployed to the default policy project for the integration server specified above.

### Running the pipeline and validating the results

Assuming the pipeline parameters have been modified in the Jenkinsfile, the pipeline can be run
using "Build with Parameters" on the desired branch. This should start the pipeline, which will
then pull the source down, compile and test it, and then deploy it to the integration node.

If the pipeline fails immediately with logs ending in
```
...
[Pipeline] // node
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
ERROR: CT_JDBC
Finished: FAILURE
```
then this is usually a credentials issue; verify that the credentials are created correctly
with the correct name and contents.

Once the pipeline has completed successfully, the application can be tested by using a browser
or curl to access the application API endpoint at http://localhost:7800/tea/index/1 (assuming a
node without MQ on the default HTTP per-server listener port), which is likely to return null
values unless there is data in the database already:
```
C:\>curl http://localhost:7800/tea/index/1
{"name":null,"id":"1"}
```

To add tea to the index, curl can be used:
```
curl -X POST --data '{"name": "Assam", "strength": 5}' http://localhost:7800/tea/index
```

## ACE-as-a-Service target

See [README-aceaas-pipelines.md](README-aceaas-pipelines.md) for a general overview. The
Jenkins pipeline for ACEaaS looks as follows, with the (optional) "Create Configurations and IR"
shown as running only for the initial build:

![Pipeline overview](/demo-infrastructure/images/jenkins-aceaas-pipeline.png)

Similar to the integration node pipeline, the following values should be changed in
[Jenkinsfile.aceaas](/demo-infrastructure/Jenkinsfile.aceaas) or set when running the build:

- deployPrefix, which is used as a prefix for the various configurations to avoid conflicts on shared services.
- APPCON_ENDPOINT, which is the API endpoint.
- DEPLOY_CONFIGURATION, which enables the "Create Configurations and IR" stage and defaults to `false` but should be set to `true` for the initial configuration creation.

To create the pipeline (and following the Jenkins pipeline tour instructions), a "multibranch 
pipeline" should be created and pointed at the github repo. This pipeline must refer to 
`demo-infrastructure/Jenkinsfile.aceaas` and not the default `Jenkinsfile`.

Once the pipeline has been created and branches configured, the `CT_JDBC` credentials should
be created as described in the integration node section above, and additional credentials are 
needed for ACEaaS. See [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/saas?topic=overview-accessing-api](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/saas?topic=overview-accessing-api)
for details on how to create the correct credentials, and then set the following as "secret text" values:

- APPCON_INSTANCE_ID is the instance identifier (similar to `2vkpa0udw`)
- APPCON_CLIENT_ID is the client ID created from the "Public API credentials" section of the ACEaaS dashboard 
- APPCON_CLIENT_SECRET is the client secret created from the "Public API credentials" section of the ACEaaS dashboard 
- APPCON_API_KEY is the API key created from the ACEaaS dashboard 

The pipeline could be changed to store APPCON_ENDPOINT as a credential as well (similar to the
Tekton equivalent), but the URL is not secret so in the default case it is provided in the Jenkinsfile.

The pipeline should create the required configurations based on the JDBC credentials
and other values if the DEPLOY_CONFIGURATION is set to `true`; this should only be used
for the first pipeline run or after any change to the credentials (see the "ACEaaS API rate 
limits" section of [README-aceaas-pipelines.md](README-aceaas-pipelines.md) for more information).

### Running the pipeline and validating the results

Assuming the pipeline parameters have been modified in demo-infrastructure/Jenkinsfile.aceaas, the 
pipeline can be run using "Build with Parameters" on the desired branch. This should start the 
pipeline, which will then pull the source down, compile and test it, and then deploy it to ACEaaS.

Once the pipeline has completed and the integration runtime has started, the application can be
tested by using a browser or curl to access the application API endpoint. The endpoint can be 
found from the ACEaaS UI by examining the deployed REST API as shown:

![aceaas-rest-api-endpoint.png](aceaas-rest-api-endpoint.png)

The endpoint should be of the form `https://tdolby-tea-jenkins-ir-https-ac2vkpa0udw.p-vir-d1.appconnect.ibmappdomain.cloud/tea`
and (similar to the integration node example above) curl can be used to retrieve or add data.
```
C:\>curl https://tdolby-tea-jenkins-ir-https-ac2vkpa0udw.p-vir-d1.appconnect.ibmappdomain.cloud/tea/index/1
{"name":"Assam","id":"1"}
```

## Common errors

Incorrect credentials in Jenkins can cause component test failures while leaving the unit 
tests running successfully.

Missing TEAJDBC policy in the integration node causes runtime errors:
```
BIP2230E: Error detected whilst processing a message in node &apos;gen.TeaRESTApplication.getIndex (Implementation).GetFromDB.Get DB record&apos;. <br>
BIP6253E: Error in node: getIndex (Implementation).GetFromDB.Get DB record. Could not locate JDBC Provider policy
&apos;TEAJDBC&apos;, in the specified or default policy project, for the data source name property on this node.
```

Missing JDBC credentials shows a different runtime error:
```
BIP2230E: Error detected whilst processing a message in node &apos;gen.TeaRESTApplication.getIndex (Implementation).GetFromDB.Get DB record&apos;. <br>
BIP6278E: Node &apos;getIndex (Implementation).GetFromDB.Get DB record&apos; is unable to create a connection 
with the datasource represented by JDBCProviders policy name &apos;TEAJDBC&apos;, because of incomplete configuration
settings. The JDBCProviders policy has been configured with securityIdentity property value &apos;tea&apos;, which 
has not been defined by using the mqsisetdbparms or mqsicredentials command.
```

## Possible enhancements

The pipeline could use a configuration file to contain the DB2 database location and the location of the 
integration node, all of which are currently parameters for the pipeline itself.
