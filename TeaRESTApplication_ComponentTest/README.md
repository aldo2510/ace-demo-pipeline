# TeaRESTApplication_ComponentTest

Code for testing the main Tea application's connections to JDBC; refers to TeaRESTApplication
and TeaSharedLibrary in order to unit test the JDBC interaction nodes.

These tests require a JDBC policy and credentials in the same way the main application does.
Assuming the work directory has been set up correctly, then these tests can be run from the
command line, Maven build, or the toolkit.
